## Overview

I wanted to replicate this design I found online but add a mouse parallax to the landscape elements in the background so it looks like you're zooming in. It turned out pretty well but you have to imagine what this could look like if an actual illustrator provided me illustrations!

This is the design inspiration:

This is a screenshot of the app:

Install to check out the parallax effect. Also check out my [documentation](https://github.com/hackersupreme/mouse-parallax-example-documentation) on mouse parallaxes with the animation library [React Spring](https://www.react-spring.io/)

Note: desktop only at this time since you only really get the mouse experience on desktops.

## Installation

This assumes you have the following installed:
  - node.js 
  - node package manager (npm)

Get both here: https://nodejs.org/

###### Instructions

1. Create file directory on your local device
2. Download files to that directory

_note: PNG images are for this document, not needed for the project_

3. Using a command line software, enter the directory
```
cd directory-name
```
4. Use npm install to get the node modules
```
npm install
```
5. Use npm start to start the server
```
npm start
```
